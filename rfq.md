# 1.0 Background Overview and Objective

## Agency Background

The Office of Head Start (OHS) is responsible for administering the Head
Start program, which provides grants to local public and private
non-profit and for-profit agencies to provide comprehensive child
development services to economically disadvantaged children and their
families. The office is located in the Administration for Children and
Families (ACF), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

There are over 1,600 Head Start grantees, ranging from small agencies
with little organizational capacity serving less than 100 children to
large agencies with complex staffs serving tens of thousands of
children. A number of grantees also have delegate agencies which provide
all or part of the required comprehensive services.

Head Start programs enhance the multi-faceted development of enrolled
children. In FY2020, over a million children received Head Start
services supporting their development and learning, health, and family
well-being. Through relationships with adults, play, and planned and
spontaneous instruction, children receive individualized learning
experiences. Parents and families are offered program services to
support family well-being and to achieve family goals, such as housing
stability, continued education, and financial security. Since its
beginning in 1965, Head Start has served more than 33 million children
and their families.

OHS is the national agency responsible for awarding funding, developing
and enforcing policies, and providing technical assistance and oversight
to ensure that Head Start programs deliver high quality services.
Through the Head Start Information and Communication Center (HSICC) OHS
provides critical policy, guidance and technical assistance information
to Head Start programs, prospective parents, the early childhood
community, and the public.

## Systems Background

In service of its mission, OHS operates four primary IT systems:

-   The Head Start Enterprise System (HSES) is the centerpiece of OHS’
    IT. It is a Java system, and is currently transitioning from
    on-premises servers to cloud.gov’s platform.

-   The Information Technology - Aligned Monitoring System (IT-AMS)
    provides a custom interface for the grantee monitoring process. It
    receives data from HSES through daily data transfers. It is a Java
    system running on Microsoft Azure.

-   The Early Childhood Learning and Knowledge Center (ECLKC) website is
    the public face of the program, and provides access to
    implementation resources for programs, regions, and states. It
    also offers [<u>an API that provides access to Head Start
    data</u>](https://eclkc.ohs.acf.hhs.gov/developers/guide). It is
    primarily a Drupal system running on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

-   The SmartHub is an in-progress system to collect and process data
    about OHS’s training and technical assistance programs for
    grantees. It is a Node.js application running on the cloud.gov
    platform.

<img src="media/image1.png" style="width:3.32292in;height:2.36076in" />

In addition to these systems, OHS also operates a collection of
applications built by the National Training and Technical Assistance
(TTA) Centers. These applications are housed within the AWS environment
maintained by the ECLKC project.

### ECLKC System Background

ECLKC currently receives over 2 million visits per year, approximately
25% on mobile devices. Numerous federal and contract staff contribute to
the content, including six OHS National TTA Centers, each with specific
areas of expertise. The centers’ subject matter experts work with the
contributing partners and technical liaisons to assure content is
created, maintained, archived, and deleted according to OHS and HHS
quality requirements.

ECLKC hosts over 8,600 pages with many file formats, including .pdf
documents, .MP4 videos, and interactive online lessons. ECLKC is an
instance of the Drupal 8 content management platform with numerous
linked databases and directories, supported by link checkers, web
analytics, taxonomy management, and a robust search engine.

In addition to the primary ECLKC system, the ECLKC infrastructure also
hosts applications for the National TTA Centers. Currently, these
applications are sent to the ECLKC hosting team and deployed during a
monthly maintenance window.

The diagram below shows the current ECLKC system architecture, including
the primary ECLKC Drupal site and National TTA Centers applications.

<img src="media/image2.png" style="width:6.39063in;height:5.56387in" />

ECLKC is currently supported by several teams: a large interdisciplinary
team that maintain the user-facing Drupal site, and a single scrum team
that operates and maintains the infrastructure supporting the Drupal
site and various National Centers applications. These teams use a mix of
automated and manual processes to develop and deploy changes. For
example, the development team uses Jenkins to run automated tests for
code changes, which are deployed through a manual process during which
the site is set to a read-only mode.

# 2.0 Scope

## 2.1 Product Vision

This product will empower and amplify the work of program staff, giving
them the information and tools they need to continue their work in
support of children and families. In an ideal future, this looks like:

**Product teams are focused on delivering value to their users, instead
of worrying about how to deploy infrastructure.**

-   Infrastructure evolves to meet product team needs

-   Dependencies and asks of the infrastructure team are prioritized
    based on OHS’ mission and program goals

-   Lower the time and energy to begin new work

**Technology thoughtfully promotes collaboration between OHS program
teams.**

-   Transparent infrastructure

-   Between OHS and Quoters

-   Between different Quoter technical teams

**Code deployment is consistent, repeatable, and automated across OHS.**

-   Lightweight, repeatable deploy process using CI/CD

-   Environments (ex. Dev, test, staging, prod) have parity

-   Automated testing throughout

-   Reliable, secure, compliant

**Software is built with the future in mind.**

-   Easy to modify

-   Easy to transition teams as needed

-   Non-proprietary interfaces, data formats, etc

## 2.2 Description of work to be performed

OHS is seeking support for the hosting and infrastructure of its IT
systems, beginning with the ECLKC Drupal site and various National TTA
Centers applications. In accordance with the Federal Information
Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA), the proposed Quoter support
team for OHS Hosting and Infrastructure services will provide expanded
configuration, management, and development of infrastructure tools and
services for all Head Start IT applications, starting with ECLKC. The
team will create efficiencies and economies of scale across the
organization and assist OHS leaders in identifying innovative best
practices, which can also be shared among Head Start IT assets and serve
as a model to other ACF Program Offices. The Quoter will coordinate with
the OHS IT Governance Board, aligning the tasks with OHS goals and
mission.

In short, OHS is seeking support for the management for the
infrastructure of its IT systems, including:

1.  The management and configuration of cloud hosting tools such as
    Infrastructure-as-a-Service providers and Platform-as-a-Service
    providers.

2.  Design and implementation of DevOps tools and practices such as
    deployment pipelines and continuous integration.

3.  Consultation with product teams on infrastructure-related tasks, and
    with OHS leadership on technical strategies.

4.  The management and configuration of shared services such as central
    authentication tools and internal data APIs.

This infrastructure and DevOps support will use agile principles
incrementally designing and building infrastructure tools and practices
for use across the OHS organization. This involves identifying, scoping,
and prioritizing tasks within the objectives set forth below.

The infrastructure team’s objectives include:

-   A healthy ecosystem for developing and deploying software

-   Documentation of the infrastructure, including configurations for
    supported applications and processes for common tasks

-   Continued authorization to operate the infrastructure and the
    products using it

-   Customer service and support for product teams at OHS, including
    support for developed processes or tools, consultations on
    infrastructure-related questions, and assistance with migration to
    the shared infrastructure

-   An incremental, flexible strategy, produced collaboratively with
    OHS, for architecting and scaling infrastructure across multiple
    systems

-   Standard processes or tools for common product team tasks, such as
    automated testing and continuous deployment

OHS requires the Quoter to have the capability to successfully ramp up
and have available qualified staff who are fully knowledgeable of
hosting, production and maintenance services.

## 2.3 Task 1 - Supporting ECLKC hosting infrastructure and DevOps practices

As a first step, the Quoter will be responsible for managing the hosting
infrastructure for the ECLKC Drupal site and various National Centers
applications, which enable knowledge sharing amongst the various levels
of Head Start providers. This may include:

-   Provisioning, configuring, and maintaining the ECLKC infrastructure.
    The current architecture is laid out below.

-   Supporting the ECLKC Drupal development team in deploying the ECLKC
    website to production, and helping to create and support a robust
    DevOps practice.

-   Development of processes or tools for common product team tasks,
    such as dependency management, shared task tracking, and
    continuous integration and continuous deployment components of a
    deployment pipeline

-   Co-developing and upholding clear technical standards for code
    deployed to the ECLKC infrastructure

-   Deploying applications to production on behalf of National Centers.

-   Maintaining the system’s Authority to Operate

## 2.4 Task 2 - Scaling infrastructure and DevOps support to additional OHS systems

Based on the approach developed with an ECLKC pilot, this team will
expand their responsibilities to configure, manage, and develop
infrastructure tools and services for all OHS. This team will manage a
hosting environment and practices to enable development teams and third
parties to more efficiently and securely deploy software features. The
team will help OHS take advantage of economies of scale across the
organization, assist OHS leaders in prioritizing and implementing shared
services. This may include:

-   Managing and administering commercial infrastructure tools, such as
    infrastructure-as-a-service providers, code repositories, and
    deployment pipelines, to create a sustainable and extensible
    infrastructure for products.

-   Providing support and advice to assist product teams in deploying
    their software in the hosted environment.

-   Developing custom software to support a robust DevOps practice.

-   A process for continuously identifying and prioritizing
    infrastructure work needed to support teams across OHS

-   A strategy, produced collaboratively with OHS, for architecting and
    scaling infrastructure across multiple systems

-   Collaborating with OHS staff and other Quoter teams to curate and
    uphold clear technical standards and best practices for code
    deployed within the OHS ecosystem

-   Curation of a healthy ecosystem for developing and deploying
    software

-   Customer service and support for product teams at OHS, including
    support for developed processes or tools, consultations on
    infrastructural questions, and assistance with migration to the
    shared infrastructure

-   Documentation of the infrastructure, including configurations for
    supported applications and processes for common tasks

-   Assistance in maintaining and continuing authorization to operate
    the infrastructure and the products hosted using the
    infrastructure

-   Documenting and sharing the code and processes to allow internal and
    external developers to understand how to deploy on the
    infrastructure.

# 3.0 Anticipated Period of Performance and Budget

The initial (base) period of performance (POP) for this order is 12
months. There will also be four (4) option periods of 12 months each,
for a total possible period of performance of 60 months. The POP is
expected to begin on the date of the contract kickoff meeting.

Quoters are expected to submit a proposal assuming an approximate budget
of $1.3M for the base year, $1.3M for option 1, $1.35M for option 2,
$1.4M for option 3 and $1.45 for option 4. Quoters are expected to
submit a quote reflective of its solution to fulfill the Government’s
requirements.

#

# 4.0 Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan

The government uses the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP,
“kwasp”) to monitor the quality of Quoter’s performance and deliverables
throughout the contract. This QASP provides the government a proactive
way to avoid unacceptable or deficient performance and provides the
basis for performance ratings in the Performance Assessment Reporting
System (CPARS, “see-pars”).

Because there are many acceptable approaches to this contract’s
objectives, this QASP provides high-level performance standards and
describes their purpose. As part of the contract kick-off process, the
Quoter will work with the COR to create a detailed set of performance
standards and accompanying methods of assessment. The QASP
Implementation Guide below shall serve as the default and starting point
for revisions.

The COR will perform the assessments detailed in the QASP Implementation
Guide, though they may choose to delegate tasks to another OHS staff
member where that other staff member has relevant subject matter
expertise. It is expected that assessment intervals will begin with a
more frequent pace and can be gradually lengthened as the Quoter and
government build a collaborative relationship.

The QASP Implementation Guide may be updated at the discretion of the
COR and should serve as a living document that reflects the working
standards and processes of the team. Updates to these overarching
procedures may be made by modification to the contract.

## 4.1 Customer service posture

As a support team, the Quoter should be able to clearly demonstrate that
it is serving the team’s customers. These customers are most likely to
be the various OHS product teams, but may include other elements of OHS
in service of the contract’s objectives.

This element is also closely connected to other QASP elements.
**Well-maintained documentation** is one way to provide proactive
support, and **soliciting feedback** is one way to unearth likely
issues.

Likely elements may include:

-   Timely responses to requests

-   Timely resolution of issues or requests

-   Proactive work to avoid likely issues

-   Adoption of team-maintained components by OHS product teams

## 4.2 Well-maintained documentation

Clear, usable documentation is critical to the success of this work.
Having a collaborative plan for creating, updating, and assessing
documentation is an important part of this work, and empowering the OHS
team. Specific documentation types may include:

-   System documentation, including all elements required by the ATO

-   Custom tooling documentation, including installation and
    instructions for use

-   Process documentation, all steps required in a given process

As a general guide, any work that is tracked should be documented in
some form.

Likely elements include:

-   Documentation is kept up to date, using prominent timestamps and
    review/confirmation process, assessed by confirming documentation
    submission along with task completion.

-   Documentation is stored in a system owned by OHS, and can be
    directly accessed by OHS staff and product teams, assessed by a
    periodic documentation review.

-   Process documentation is written in plain language, following a
    logical step-by-step flow from the perspective of a learner,
    assessed by periodic user testing.

## 4.3 Informed work

This work will be prioritized by and connect clearly to the technical
strategy of OHS. As the OHS strategy changes and matures, so too may the
work’s priorities; regular checks are necessary to maintain alignment
and address differences or gaps. If this is successful, OHS staff should
be able to understand the work of the team even if they are not
proficient with technology infrastructure.

Likely elements include:

-   Create and maintain a customer research plan, with regular revision
    after each round of research

-   Conduct regular customer research, with findings addressed and
    integrated into ongoing documentation.

-   Synthesize research findings, and share them with OHS staff and
    product teams.

-   Consideration of the broader OHS ecosystem, including product teams
    that rely on the shared infrastructure, and teams that aren’t yet
    using it.

-   Actively solicit feedback, with clear directions on how to send it
    and how it will be read, shared, and used.

## 4.4 Transparent work

The trust needed in a collaborative environment is supported by working
in the open, and being transparent. The COR will have administrative
rights to all tools and locations, which may include:

-   Task tracking

-   Custom code

-   Infrastructure-related metrics and data (e.g. uptime, estimated
    costs)

Likely elements include:

-   Project tasks will be meaningful and well-scoped, assessed by a
    periodic review of completed tasks and the backlog, such as
    whether tasks tend to be completed within one sprint.

-   The team’s task backlog is accessible to OHS staff and to OHS
    product teams, assessed by a periodic check.

-   Custom code is stored in a repository accessible to OHS staff, and
    is licensed for continued use by OHS, assessed by a periodic
    check.

## 4.5 Impact

The team is making a difference in the work of product teams and for OHS
overall, helping to adopt modern best practices for infrastructure and
DevOps.

Likely elements include:

-   Work with OHS is highly collaborative

-   Successful adoption of DevOps practices by product teams, assessed
    using a collaboratively-developed shared infrastructure roadmap
    and by the usage of modern approaches like automated tests,
    automated deployments, and zero-downtime deployments by product
    teams

-   Ease of deployment by product teams to the shared infrastructure,
    assessed by the ability of product teams to deploy independently
    and continuously

-   Support for product ATO processes, assessed by POAM resolutions and
    timely completion of any ATO-related tasks

-   High infrastructure uptime, assessed by a periodic review of
    infrastructure data

#  Contract Place of Performance and Contract Type

## 5.1 Place of Performance

Any work done, whether onsite or offsite, must be covered by the rate
agreed upon between the government and Quoter. Normal working hours are
from 9:00AM to 5:00PM Eastern Time, Monday through Friday. The Quoter
will generally be expected to be readily available during core working
hours from 10:00am to 4:00pm Eastern Time, Monday through Friday. They
are not expected to work federal holidays. Quoters must seek approval
from the COR to continue work outside of normal working hours.

The Quoter may choose the location(s) from which to perform the required
infrastructure support services. The Quoter will not be required to work
at a government facility; however, occasional travel to government
facilities may be required. Actual travel costs to government facilities
will be reimbursed in accordance with [<u>federal travel
regulation</u>](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/regulations/federal-travel-regulation-ftr).
All travel must be approved by the COR prior to booking.

## 5.2 Contract Type

The government intends to award a time and material (T&M) type contract.
All rates shall be fully burdened and T&M rates are fixed at the time of
award. The offeror must specify whether the fixed hourly rate for each
labor category applies to labor performed by (1) the offeror; (2)
subQuoters; and/or (3) divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates or the
offeror under a common control.

#  Operating Constraints (Non-functional Requirements)

## 6.1 System Access

All Quoter personnel working under the resulting contract will need to
obtain a Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12
([<u>HSPD-12</u>](https://www.dhs.gov/homeland-security-presidential-directive-12))
low risk security clearance (or moderate risk security clearance if
handling PII).

In addition, the Quoter’s key personnel will need to obtain a personal
identity verification (PIV) card in order to perform system integration
work. See Appendix 1 - Section 1.6 for details.

Personnel that are required to obtain a PIV card will be issued a
government-furnished laptop from HHS/OHS. Any work that requires access
to and handling of PII must be performed on the HHS/OHS
government-furnished laptop. Personnel that are not required to obtain a
PIV card can use Quoter-furnished equipment to perform work. The
government does not anticipate that Quoter personnel will need to access
PII data initially.

Quoters may have to establish multi-factor authentication (MFA) to
access systems that require government laptops with PIV cards or to
access other applications that require MFA.

# 7.0 Personnel Skills and Knowledge

The Quoter must designate who will fill these three roles: Facilitator,
Technical Lead, and Security Lead. The roles may be filled by the same
or different people, and as a result there should be between one and
three key personnel.

**The Facilitator** will be a direct liaison to the government product
team. They will be responsible for ensuring a healthy and effective
team, including both government and Quoter personnel. This person will
ensure that all Quoter personnel are aligned around a set of shared team
goals and have clear, actionable tasks that support those goals. This
person should have a background as a scrum master, product manager,
agile coach, or a similar role.

**The Technical Lead** must have a full understanding of the technical
approach to be used by the Quoter’s team and will be responsible for
ensuring that the Quoter’s team follows that approach. This person will
ensure that the technical approach is robust, scalable, and
maintainable. They will also manage technical debt and provide strategic
input to their government partners about shared services at OHS. This
person should have a background as a DevOps engineer, software engineer,
or equivalent.

**The Security Lead** must have a full understanding of the security
approach and compliance requirements to be used by the Quoter’s team and
will be responsible for ensuring that the Quoter’s team follows that
approach. This person should have a background in information security
and have experience with federal ATO processes or a similar complex
compliance structure.

## 7.2 Key Personnel Substitution

Key Personnel substitutions must be submitted to the contracting officer
(CO) and COR in writing, and will only be justified in the event of
sudden illness, death, change of employment, or termination of
employment for cause. Requests for a substitution of Key Personnel must
include a detailed explanation of the justifying circumstances, and a
complete résumé for the proposed substitute or addition, including
skills, experience, training, and security clearance level (if
applicable). The CO’s failure to approve a proposed substitution will
not constitute grounds for non-performance by the Quoter, or form a
valid basis for any claim for money or any equitable adjustment.

## 7.3 Skills

The relevant skills for this project may include:

-   Project Management

-   Business Analyst Cloud Architecture

-   Sr. Software Engineering (Cloud practitioner)

-   Site Reliability Engineering

-   Identity / Authentication Engineering

-   Configuration Management/DevOps Engineering

-   Data Science

-   Experience with ATO’s

# 8.0 Administration

## 8.1 Government Personnel

This acquisition will be administered by the following individuals, who
will also monitor Quoter performance:

> GSA Contracting Officer (CO): Brian Burns
>
> GSA Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR): TBD at time of award
>
> OHS Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR): Elizabeth Borda Rivera

The government will notify the Quoter if a change occurs to either the
CO or COR. Specifically for the COR, the Quoter will receive a copy of
the “COR Delegation of Authority” assignment letter when a COR is
assigned, and the Quoter will also receive a letter rescinding the COR’s
delegation when appropriate.

## 8.2 Authorities and Delegations

8.2.1 The CO is the only person authorized to enter into or terminate
this agreement, modify any terms or conditions of this agreement, waive
any requirement of this agreement, or accept nonconforming work.

8.2.2 The CO will designate a COR at the time of award. The COR will be
responsible for technical monitoring of the Quoter's performance and
deliverables. The COR will be appointed in writing and a copy of the
appointment will be furnished to the Quoter. Changes to this delegation
will be made by written changes to the existing appointment or by
issuance of a new appointment.

8.2.3 The COR is not authorized to perform, formally or informally, any
of the following actions:

-   Promise, award, agree to award, or execute any agreement,
    modification, or notice of intent that changes or may change this
    contract

-   Waive or agree to modification of the delivery schedule

-   Make any final decision on any contract matters subject to the
    disputes clause

-   Terminate, for any reason, the Quoter's right to proceed

-   Obligate in any way, the payment of money by the government

The Quoter shall comply with the written or oral direction of the CO or
authorized representative(s) acting within the scope and authority of
the appointment memorandum. The Quoter need not proceed with direction
that it considers to have been issued without proper authority. The
Quoter shall notify the CO in writing, with as much detail as possible,
when the COR has taken an action or has issued direction (written or
oral) that the Quoter considers to exceed the COR’s appointment, within
3 days of the occurrence.

Unless otherwise provided in this agreement, the Quoter assumes all
costs, risks, liabilities, and consequences of performing any work it is
directed to perform that falls within any of the categories defined in
paragraph 8.2.3. prior to receipt of the CO’s response issued under
paragraph 8.2.4 of this clause.

8.2.4 The CO shall respond in writing within 30 days to any notice made
under paragraph 8.2.3 of this clause.

**8.2.5** The Quoter shall provide copies of all correspondence to the
CO and the COR.

**8.2.6** Any action(s) taken by the Quoter, in response to any
direction given by any person acting on behalf of the government or any
government official other than the CO or the COR acting within his or
her appointment, shall be at the Quoter’s risk.

## 8.3 Administration

Within five (5) days after award, the Quoter must provide the name of
the individual responsible for centralized contract administration in
support of all work performed under this order. This individual, at a
minimum, will serve as the point of contact for contractual issues,
invoices, and the Quoter representative for annual performance reviews
(see section 7.5).

The information, inclusive of the name of the point of contact, email,
and phone number, shall be uploaded through the Assisted Services Shared
Information System (ASSIST) Collaboration tool.

## 8.4 Post Award Orientation Conference

The government's team (CO, COR, and System Owner) will hold a kickoff
meeting (or post-award conference) with the selected Quoter within ten
calendar days of the acquisition award. This kickoff will include the
selected Quoter’s team and other relevant government staff to review and
clarify the project’s objectives, expectations from the government, and
address any questions the selected Quoter may have.

## 8.5 Performance

In accordance with FAR 8.406-7 and FAR 42.1502(c), past performance
evaluations shall be prepared at least annually, at the time the work
under the order is completed (to include options), and when an order,
individually, exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold. These
evaluations are generally for the entity, division, or unit that
performed the contract or order.

1.  Evaluating Performance: The General Services Administration uses the
    Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) module as the
    secure, confidential, information management tool to facilitate
    the performance evaluation process. CPARS enables a comprehensive
    evaluation by capturing comments from both TTS and the Quoter. The
    website for CPARS is
    [<u>http://www.cpars.gov</u>](http://www.cpars.gov). Completed
    CPARS evaluations are sent to the Past Performance Information
    Retrieval System (PPIRS) which may then be used by the federal
    acquisition community in making source selection decisions. PPIRS
    assists acquisition officials by serving as the single source for
    Quoter past performance data.

2.  CPARS Registration: Each award requiring an evaluation must be
    registered in CPARS. The awardee will receive several automated
    emails. Within thirty days of award, the Quoter will receive an
    email that contains user account information, as well as the
    applicable contract and order number(s) assigned. The Quoter will
    be granted one user account to access all evaluations.

3.  CPARS Training: The Quoter may sign up for CPARS training. A
    schedule of classes will be posted to the [<u>CPARS training
    site</u>](http://www.cpars.gov/allapps/cpcbtdlf.htm) and updated
    as needed.

4.  Quoter Representative (CR) Role: All evaluations will be sent to the
    CR named on your award. The CR will be able to access CPARS to
    review and comment on the evaluation. If your CR is not already in
    the CPARS system, the contracting officer will request the name
    and email address of the person that will be responsible for the
    CR role on your award.

Once an evaluation is ready to be released by the government, the CR
will receive an email that the evaluation is ready for their review and
comment. The email will indicate the time frame the CR has to respond to
the evaluation. The CR may return the evaluation earlier than this date.

TTS shall provide for review at a level above the contracting officer
(i.e., contracting director) to consider any disagreement between TTS
and the Quoter regarding TTS’s evaluation of the Quoter. Based on the
review, the individual at a level above the contracting officer will
issue the ultimate conclusion on the performance evaluation.  
Copies of the evaluations, Quoter responses, and review comments, if
any, will be retained as part of the contract file.

# 9.0 Invoicing

## 9.1 Invoicing Schedule

The Quoter may invoice once services or products for the awarded type
and quantity of the order have been delivered, inspected (which
includes, but is not limited to, confirming that the services were
rendered and/or product(s) were delivered and functioning properly, and
are accessible and usable by the teams using the product), and accepted
by written confirmation of the COR through the CO. Acceptance will occur
electronically via GSA’s electronic web-based order processing system,
currently ASSIST, by accepting the invoice generated by the Quoter.
Electronic acceptance of the invoice by the COR is considered
concurrence and acceptance of services.

The Quoter must submit a final invoice within 60 calendar days from
government acceptance. No further charges are to be billed following the
final invoice submission. A completed and signed Release of Claims
([<u>GSA Form
1142</u>](https://www.gsa.gov/forms-library/release-claims)) shall be
uploaded to the ASSIST with the submission of a final invoice.

## 9.2 Content of Invoice

In addition to the items below, the Quoter shall submit proper invoices
as specified in FAR 52.212-4(g):

-   GSA Order Number

-   Order ACT Number

-   Prompt Payment Discount

-   Remittance Address

-   POP for Billing Period

-   POC and Phone Number

-   Invoice Amount

-   Final Invoice Marked as “Final”

-   Name of Product, Quantity of Product, and Part Number of Product
    matching award documents.

In addition to the requirements for a proper invoice specified in FAR
52.212-4 (g), invoices must include the Prompt Payment clause, FAR
52.212-4(i)(2) and Payments under Time and Materials and Labor Hours
Contracts, FAR 52.232-7.

## 9.3 Invoice Submission

The Quoter shall submit invoices electronically by logging into the
[<u>ASSIST portal</u>](https://portal.fas.gsa.gov), navigating to the
appropriate order, and creating the invoice for that order. This is the
only acceptable means for invoice submissions.

No paper invoices shall be accepted. For additional assistance, contact
the ASSIST Helpdesk at 877-472-4877 or via email at
assist.servicedesk@gsa.gov.

## 9.4 Limitation of Funds

The Quoter shall notify the CO in writing when it has reason to believe
that the costs it expects to incur under this contract in the next 60
days, when added to all costs previously incurred, will exceed 75
percent of (1) the total amount so far allotted to the contract by the
government or, (2) if this is a cost-sharing contract, the amount then
allotted to the contract by the government plus the Quoter’s
corresponding share. The notice shall state the estimated amount of
additional funds required to continue performance for the period
specified in the contract.  

Sixty days before the end of the period specified in the contract, the
Quoter shall notify the CO in writing of the estimated amount of
additional funds, if any, required to continue timely performance under
the contract or for any further period specified in the contract or
otherwise agreed upon, and when the funds will be required.

# 10.0 Submission Instructions and Evaluation

## 10.1 Process timeline

-   Q&A / Amendments Issued Prior to RFQ closing

-   Quote submission via Google Form, with attachments.

-   Evaluating quotes for best value, looking at:

    -   Technical approach and team structure report, and responses to
        the four case studies

-   Oral interviews are conducted via 60-minute video sessions.

-   Award decisions are made in 2-3 weeks following oral interviews.

## 10.2 Quote submission guidelines

### 10.2.1 Before submitting a quote - due diligence sessions

Clear and well-written requests make it easier for competitors to submit
better proposals. Quoters who want to submit a proposal can meet with
OHS and TTS teams for a due diligence session. This gives Quoters a
better understanding of the OHS mission, and current work before they
submit a proposal. They also let Quoters ask questions in private,
without sharing details with competitors. The Government will keep all
proprietary information confidential.

The Government will provide competing Quoters equal access to data and
information and send any requests for clarity to all prime Quoters.

Representations by officers and agents do not represent the whole
Government. Quoter questions and Government responses given during due
diligence are unofﬁcial. Quoters can ask for an official response during
the process, and the Government will try to provide one.

### 10.2.2 Submission checklist

All quotes must be submitted using [<u>this Google
form</u>](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSey5QyXjfhJp2cXwNeeIevuorZh-KsS1m9hiTbrzYTez52rgA/viewform?usp=sf_link)
and include the following materials:

-   Technical approach and team structure report  
    7 pages maximum, including diagrams, 12 point font.

-   Responses to each case study  
    1 page maximum for each case study response, 4 pages in total.

-   Price Quote (spreadsheet)

-   Conflict of Interest (form to sign)

-   FAR 52.204-24 Provision (checkbox on Google form)

-   (Optional) Quoter Teaming Arrangement (CTA) - if you’re submitting a
    quote with a teaming partner. More details at:
    [<u>https://www.gsa.gov/buying-selling/purchasing-programs/gsa-schedules/schedule-features/Quoter-team-arrangements</u>](https://www.gsa.gov/buying-selling/purchasing-programs/gsa-schedules/schedule-features/contractor-team-arrangements)

**Only** submit information explicity requested in this RFQ. Do not
include assumptions, caveats, or exceptions in any part of your
submission. Failing to follow these instructions may result in removal
from consideration for the award.

### 10.2.3 Technical approach and team structure report

This section should be no more than seven (7) pages, including diagrams.
Written responses should be in 12-point font. Since many proposals will
be considered, we appreciate clear, concise writing that directly
addresses how you plan to meet project objectives.

If you are awarded this contract, this technical approach and team
structure will replace the Statement of Objectives and become the
Performance Work Statement (PWS) in the final contract.

This report should explain the following:

-   A technical approach proposal that shows your understanding of the
    details of the project and speaks to your experience with:

    -   managing web infrastructure, including configuring and managing
        modern IaaS/PaaS, configuring and managing CI/CD tools, and
        building, maintaining, and iteratively improving upon
        deployment pipelines

    -   working in a multi Quoter environment to the government’s
        benefit.

    -   working in an iterative, responsive way.

-   A management plan that addresses:

    -   How staff and resources will be allocated to accomplish project
        goals

    -   Plans for recruitment and retention of high-performing staff
        throughout the project

    -   Addressing and correcting for low performance.

-   An outline of your proposed team, including:

    -   Titles of each labor category and team structure

    -   Team experience with collaborative software development,
        especially developing modern web applications and APIs.

    -   Capabilities around information security, dependency management,
        and supporting product teams.

### 10.2.4 Case study responses

The OHS Hosting and Infrastructure services team will strengthen OHS
services and decision-making by using technology to save time, effort,
and cost for OHS IT systems. It will enhance communication and
collaboration across multiple programs with shared goals.

Expertise from Quoters and IT acquisition specialists critical to OHS’
mission. Developing a hosting infrastructure is an investment that will
serve ACF in future development work. The processes and tools developed
and the expertise gained through this work can be used in other Program
Offices’ applications. The application also supports HHS’s
standardization in developing mission-critical infrastructure with a
forward-reaching and secure approach to IT.

Detail **HOW** you would approach each of the following technical case
studies. One page maximum per case study, four pages all together.

**Case Study 1  
***ECLKC makes use of a [<u>Central Authentication System (CAS) to
provide authentication and authorization for all
users.</u>](https://eclkc.ohs.acf.hhs.gov/cas/login) This system is not
used by other technical teams at OHS, but there is value in converging
on a shared system. Explain how you would:*

1.  assess the level of difficulty and work needed to scale the existing
    CAS;

2.  roll out a shared solution to teams across OHS; and

3.  communicate with the teams during this process.**  
    **

**Case Study 2  
***The Early Childhood Learning and Knowledge Center is currently a
Drupal application deployed to AWS.*

1.  How would you migrate this product to be deployed to cloud.gov
    instead?

2.  How would you mitigate the risk of data loss during the migration?

**Case Study 3  
***Several of the National Centers have hired Quoter teams to design and
develop interactive web applications that are deployed to ECLKC’s
infrastructure. These applications don’t have clear software development
standards, and it’s not always obvious who is responsible for
maintenance after they have launched. The requirements follow a
communication path, from:*

1.  the ECLKC hosting team to

2.  the Federal Project Officer overseeing the particular National
    Center to

3.  the National Center’s primary point of contact with OHS to

4.  the Quoters hired by the National Center.

Explain how you would:

1.  create and maintain technical standards for applications deployed to
    ECLKC infrastructure;

2.  establish accountability for application maintenance; and

3.  communicate with all involved parties during this process.

**Case Study 4**

*Each of the four technical systems at OHS houses data that is valuable
to the users of the other systems.*

1.  How would you design an API to make grantee information from one of
    the systems available to the other three?

2.  How would you scale from a single API to an entire ecosystem of
    shared data?

### 10.2.5 Price Quote

Quoters shall submit a price quote, utilizing [<u>Attachment B - ECLKC
Pricing
Sheet</u>](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LVFvkEXkVmIz5bxc4DAyU5XAV4l403XCFiGUvq-tgBM/edit#gid=2105531986)
for all work described in the RFQ, SOO and QASP. Missing or incomplete
pricing data may result in the quote no longer being considered.

The first section of Attachment B labeled “Labor Categories” are labor
categories (LCATs) that are consistent among all offerors. Offerors must
crosswalk these LCATs to the most appropriate LCAT contained in their
GSA Schedule contract.

TTS will evaluate the price quote to determine that the total proposed
price is realistic, reasonable, and fair. For award purposes, TTS will
evaluate the price quote by reviewing labor categories. The quoter shall
submit the following items for all services quoted:

● Labor Categories

● GSA Schedule Hourly Rates

● Discounted Rate

**\*Note**: Quoters must complete all Tabs in the pricing sheet. **Tab 6
labeled “Example Pricing”** must be completed so TTS can evaluate
quoter’s pricing using the discounted rates. This Tab will be utilized
for evaluation purposes only with the intent of comparing quoter prices
equally. Labor hours have been added to the sheet with the intent for
quoters to fill in their proposed Discounted Rate and Extended Example
Price.

The prices quoted must be at or below the current GSA Schedule contract
pricing. The quoter is responsible for making sure all GSA Schedule
pricing is current. TTS will verify the information from the quoter’s
GSA schedule against the pricing form contained in Attachment B. TTS
seeks additional discounts off quoter’s current GSA Schedule pricing.

## 10.3 Oral interviews

### 10.3.1 Optional advisory notice

**<u>Optional Advisory Notice:</u>** In an effort to save both the
government and offerors time and resources, this procurement will be
conducted as a phased approach. After Technical Evaluation Factor 1
submissions are evaluated, quoters will receive an advisory notice from
the Contracting Officer via e-mail. If Technical Evaluation Factor 1 is
rated with “High Confidence,” the advisory notice will inform the
respondent if it is among the most highly competitive and will be
invited to participate in the Technical Evaluation Factor 2 - Oral
Interview. If Technical Evaluation Factor 1 is rated less than “High
Confidence,” the advisory notice will inform the respondent it is
unlikely to be a viable competitor.

Notwithstanding the advice provided by the Contracting Officer in
response to Technical Evaluation Factor 1 submissions, quoters may elect
to participate in the Technical Evaluation Factor 2 (Oral Interview). In
making a decision to proceed regardless of being advised not to
continue, please note that technical evaluation Factor 1 (inclusive of
criteria 1 & 2) is more important than Factor 2. Also, technical
evaluation factors, when combined, are more important than price; as
Non-Price ratings become closer, price will become more important. 

Those quoters notified they are not considered among the most highly
viable competitors, but regardless choose to proceed to Technical
Evaluation Factor 2 (Oral Interview), shall send an email to the
Contracting Officer not later than 24 hours after delivery of the
advisory recommendation.

### 10.3.2 Oral presentation logistics and scheduling

The interview sessions will be conducted by video chat, though audio may
be substituted as needed. The government will coordinate and set up the
virtual meeting.

### 10.3.3 Oral presentation format and evaluation

The oral presentation associated with this RFQ does not and will not
constitute discussions or negotiations as defined in FAR part 15. TTS
will not determine a competitive range, conduct discussions, nor solicit
or allow revised quotes. The entire oral presentation will be conducted
remotely via video conference.

Each Quoter will be scheduled for a 60-minute interview with the
evaluation team so the government can ask questions based on the
Quoter's technical submission. Quoters should also introduce the
individuals on their proposed team. Lastly, the evaluation team will ask
questions about the Quoter's expertise relative to the project.

The Introductions phase of each interview will last no longer than five
minutes. The Quoter and government interview team members will introduce
themselves during this time.

Each interview will include an unstructured question and answer session
during which Quoters will be asked about their technical submission
(Phase 1). The government expects these interviews to assist with
assessing the technical abilities of the proposed development team and
to better understand the proposed technical approach described in the
Quoter’s submission. The Quoter’s proposed team should participate in
the interview.

The Open Technical Session of each interview will last no more than 45
minutes. During this phase the Quoter interview team will respond to the
government’s questions related to the technical aspects of the Quoter’s
quote. Quoters will NOT be able to use or present any slides, graphs,
charts, or other written presentation materials, including handouts.
There will be no follow-up session for further questions from the Quoter
after this part of the interview.

The Closing Remarks phase of each interview will last no more than five
minutes, during which the Quoter may make a short presentation
summarizing their responses to the government’s questions.

The interview associated with this RFQ does not and will not constitute
discussions or negotiations as defined in FAR Part 15. Statements made
during an interview will not become part of the contract. The government
will not determine a competitive range, conduct discussions, nor solicit
or allow revised quotes.

## 10.4 Submission evaluation

OHS will evaluate the submitted quotes against the criteria set forth
below and then make an award based on best value using tradeoffs. OHS
will award an agreement resulting from this RFQ to the responsible
quoter whose quote conforms to the RFQ and represents the best value to
the government, price and the other criteria specified below considered.
Quoters are advised that both the technical evaluation factors and
Criteria 1 and 2 of Factor 1 are in descending order of importance. The
technical evaluation factors, when combined, are more important than
price; as Non-Price ratings become closer, price will become more
important.

-   Technical Evaluation Factor 1 – Technical Response

    -   Criteria 1 - Technical Approach and Team Structure

    -   Criteria 2 - Case Study

-   Technical Evaluation Factor 2 - Oral Interview

-   Factor 3 - Price Proposal

Technical Evaluation Factors 1 and 2 will be assigned a confidence
rating.

TTS will evaluate price quotes for award purposes by evaluating the
hourly rate for each labor category and the overall discount provided
off the quoter’s GSA schedule pricing. This will include evaluating
sample quantities for the purpose of considering the estimated total
cost to the Government. TTS may determine that a quote is unacceptable
if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options
under FAR 52.217-8 will be accomplished by using the prices offered for
the last option period to determine the price for a 6-month option
period, which will be added to the base and other option years to arrive
at the total price. Evaluation of options will not obligate the
Government to exercise the option(s).
